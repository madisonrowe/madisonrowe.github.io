		            <p class="pos">So far, the Alpha program is really nice. I enjoy that Lane includes these types of programs, programs that focus on STEM, because I personally favor STEM-related classes over the humanities, so I feel like I'm getting a lot of opportunities to take classes that will help prepare me for my future.</p>

		        <div class="col-md-6">
		            <p class="pos">I also really enjoy that there is a huge amount of outdoor space on campus. I anticipate walking around the campus when we finally go back to in-person learning, and just taking in the landscape. Though many people may say that Lane Tech is "too big", I like it because there are a lot of students to fill the space and there is more room for extracurricular activities and classrooms.</p>

		            <h2>What I Like About Online Classes:</h2>
		            <p class="likes">I like that we don't have to worry about commuting to and from the school, especially since Chicago is fairly busy most of the time and especially around big schools, like Lane Tech, because there are so many students trying to commute at the same time. I also like that the teachers understand that online learning is new for us, so they take teaching a little slower, than I thought they would, in order for the students to be able to handle the change.</p>

		            <h2>What I Dislike About Online Classes:</h2>
		            <p class="dislikes">I dislike that there is a lack of communication because of online learning. Student-to-teacher communication is perfectly fine, but student-to-student communication is very limited for me. I feel that it is much more difficult to socialize and make friends since we were are online mainly because we would have to devote even more time on our devices to keep up communication with our mutuals instead of seeing and talking with them in person.</p>
